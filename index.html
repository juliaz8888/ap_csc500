      A social and political activism app brought to you by Technovation team Fempower.
    </p>

  <h3>APP DESCRIPTION</h3>
  <p id="first-paragraph">
    We all have political and social issues that we care about, but it’s tough to find time to keep up with
    these issues. Many of us get stuck in inaction, thinking “How much difference can one person make anyway?”
    Echo is an efficient, user-friendly social activism app that makes it quick and easy for users to keep up with
    their favorite causes and to find minor or major ways that they can pitch in. We want to make every contribution
    possible, no matter how small!

  <h3>TEAM DESCRIPTION</h3>
  <p>
    Fempower, a group located in Andover, Massachusetts, is comprised of four high schoolers from Phillips Academy Andover:
    Jennie Guo, Anjalie Kini, Sarah Zhao, and Julia Zhu. Members of our community wanted to be more involved in social and
    political activism but were blocked by logistics, so we decided to create a solution. Through our iOS app, Echo, we aim
    to make activism and engagement quicker, easier, and more accessible so that everyone’s voice can be heard.
